title: Workshops
description: Writing workshops I give

---
<p>In July 2021, I gave two writing workshops as part of
<a href=https://www.arthereistanbul.com/corymassaro alt="Cory's Resident Page on arthereistanbul">my residency at arthereistanbul</a>.
These workshops combined textual generation concepts borrowed from Surrealism,
divinatory practices, and big data techniques; the results were the product equally
of intuition and intellect, and of collaboration among participants both human and machine.</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by efforts to approach (or create) text that allow mediation by subtle forces. In divinatory practices, the subtle forces are conceived as metaphysical or spiritual: when one performs bibliomancy, one allows for the possibility that something guides the hand, and makes the finger land on a specific page, and causes the eye to fall on a particular line. When reading the Tarot, something causes the cards to emerge in a particular order and assume their fated positions within the narrative frame of the reading. Whether that something be a distinct spiritual presence, a universal immanence, one's own energetic aptitude, or simple randomness/entropy (perhaps in personified form)—in any case, the diviner cedes control to that subtle force, welcome its input, and then accesses their own intuitive and rational powers to spin a narrative.</p>

<p>In this view, algorithmic text generation methods like William S. Burroughs's cut-up method or black-out poetry or games like Exquisite Corpse constitute extensions of divinatory practice. They read the auguries from paper cranes.</p>

<p>Corpus linguistics, natural language processing, and data mining offer other subtle avenues to finding narrative. The spirits here are a bit better defined, and one can even manipulate them directly. If Exquisite Corpse is paper augury, then the techniques I'll talk about here are more like consulting a distant oracle; and when a programmer gets involved, they're digital haruspicy—digging around in a virtual guinea pig's guts.</p>

<p>For these workshops, I created large text corpora in a number of languages, according to the needs of the participants [Modern Standard Arabic, English, French, Kurdish (Kurmancî), Persian (فارسی), Spanish (Castellano), and Urdu]. With this text data, I trained the oracle using a technique called word2vec. This technique relies solely on the order in which words are found in text; however, it produces oracles with surprisingly accurate ideas of which words' meanings are similar, and even permits oracles to perform some analogical reasoning. For example, the English-language oracle thinks that the word "flower" is similar to words like "mushroom," "leaf," and "bean"; and if you provide it the analogy <code>Paris:France::Beijing:?</code>, it gives the very reasonable answer, "China."</p>

<p><a href=https://corymassaro.com/oracle/ alt="The Language Garbage Oracle">The oracle</a>
sees words and concepts as many-dimensional vectors. This means it can move between words by gradually moving along these vectors,
in many directions at once, from its many-faceted vision of one word to that of another word.
In the workshop, we played with different starting and ending points, having the oracle recite lists of words to us as it encountered them in its passage.
When the oracle would complete one of its word-trails, we would use the listed words in order as the seed of a poem or story.</p>

<p>We also explored the oracle's analogical powers. We could click on one of the words it had given us,
and the oracle would tell us a few other words it thought were similar.
From there, too, we could derive creative insight:
